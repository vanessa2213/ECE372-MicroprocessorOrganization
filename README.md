# ECE372-MicroprocessorOrganization
I took this class during my exchange program. I visit The University of Arizona on Fall 2021.

This course is an introduction to microcontroller organization, hardware interfacing, and system design. Topics include, but are not limited to: C Programming for Microcontrollers, Memory Organization and Addressing Modes, Interrupts, Timers, Parallel and Serial Interfacing, Analog-to-Digital Conversion, Overview of Common Peripheral Components, Event-driven Software Development, and Motor Control. Students will also have a course project in which they will propose, design/implement, and present a self-selected project, subject to approval by the instructor.
