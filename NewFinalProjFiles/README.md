The problem to solve is to obtain some instrument that works based on distance. 
It could be a source of creativity for children or those who might not have the physical ability to play any other instrument.

The overall goal of the project is to create a working theremin. The theremin will use a buzzer as an output and two infrared sensors as inputs.
